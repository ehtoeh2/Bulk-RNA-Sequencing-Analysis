# Bulk-RNA-Sequencing-Analysis
Summary: An integrated pipeline for bulk RNA-seq analysis including DEG, ORA, GSEA, and visualization tools such as Miami and UpSet plots.


This repository contains code for integrated analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data


It provides a pipeline for differential expression analysis (DEG), over-representation analysis (ORA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)  


In addition, various visualization tools are included, such as **Volcano plot**, **Miami plots** and **UpSet plots**, to help interpret the results effectively
